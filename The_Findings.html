<h1> The Findings </h1> 
        

<p1> 

Laws and stories are usually seen as separate entities, one factual and the other fantastical. 
You might not expect the two to meet at any point, but that is what happened in the three stories I analysed for my thesis. 
The findings are really fascinating as fiction merged with reality in order to entertain. However, this isn’t really a new phenomenon. 
From Netflix to Shakespeare, reality has inspired our favourite works for centuries, and it appears that the Celtic bards and later scribes followed this same trend. 
In Tormac Étaine, the contract drawn up between the Dagda (the king of the gods in the Irish pantheon) and Elcmar (a lesser deity) is about land for Óengus (the god of love). 
The law is used but with some very creative leeway. Elcmar doesn’t realise, at any point, that the Dagda was both the king and judge. 
Thus, it makes the contract a poisoned chalice. 
 
The painful legal ignorance of the characters doesn’t stop here. Later on, a minor god named Midir tries to get his ex-wife Étaine back from her current husband. 
Midir’s entire claim on getting Étaine back, was based on a stake from a game of fidchell, often claimed to be the ancestor of chess. Here, there is something important to note: 
stakes from a game of fidchell was not a legal method of making contracts. 
The whole contract was void before it was even made! The only reason Midir got his wife back was because her current husband let her go.

If you believe that these are the only two cases of a comedic use of the law, you are quite mistaken. 
In Táin Bó Froích, Medb and Ailill, the king and queen of Connacht, try to get Froích 
(a suitor of their daughter’s with fairy heritage) to agree to an extortionate marriage contract. Froích, not being an idiot, doesn’t agree to it. 
But Medb and Ailill fear he would elope with their daughter. 
Fearing retribution from other suitors, they try to murder Froích using a water monster in their pond. 
If their murder attempt had been successful, they would have had to pay fines for secret killing because they knew the monster lived in their pond!

The Welsh also used the law to entertain, or shock in this case. In Branwen, uerch Lyr, Bendigeidfran, the king of the British Isles, and Manawydan, his brother,
asked their sister Branwen to marry the King of Ireland, Matholwch, to secure their alliance. 
The problem child of the family, Efnysien, Branwen’s half-brother, did not agree to this. So what does he do? He mutilates Matholwch’s horses. 
Whether Efnysien’s consent was legally necessary is a question posed by other academics. They agree that mutilating the horses was a step too far. 
This illegal act was supposed to be the pretext for the rest of the events that happened throughout the story.

Much like Harry Potter or Shakespeare’s Macbeth, real life concerns and attributes are used in all three Celtic stories to entertain an audience. 
Even if that audience did have some acquired tastes.
