<h1> The Findings </h1> 
        

<p> 

Irish and Welsh literature were more than mere stories. 
The great amount of medieval literature preserved in Irish and Welsh manuscripts of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries show as much. 
They were indicators of how the Irish and Welsh people viewed their culture, their history and their laws. 
The law played a guiding role in providing reasons and consequences for legal actions taken in Early Irish and Welsh society.

The investigation concentrates on contract law, and the law tracts on marriage since marriage was considered a contract in Early Irish and Welsh society. 
The literatures’ faithfulness to the regulations set by Early Irish law and the laws of Hywel Dda in relation to contract law is also explored. 
Each of the three stories involve important contracts made on inheritance and marriage between the main characters. 
The main question of this investigation is, to what extent is contract law applied in Tochmarc Étaine (‘The Wooing of Étaine’), 
Táin Bó Froích (‘The Cattle Rustling of Froích’) and Branwen, uerch Lyr (‘Branwen, daughter of Lyr’), and are the punishments in accordance with the law? 
The follow-up question is if the retribution for a breach in promise is in the confines of the law. 
I chose to explore these stories because they provide interesting examples of the use or misuse of contract law and the law tracts on marriage.
