<h1> The Findings </h1> 
        

<p1> 

Irish and Welsh literature were more than mere stories. 
The great amount of medieval literature preserved in Irish and Welsh manuscripts of the twelfth to fourteenth centuries show as much. 
They were indicators of how the Irish and Welsh people viewed their culture, their history and their laws. 
The law played a guiding role in providing reasons and consequences for legal actions taken in Early Irish and Welsh society.

The investigation concentrates on contract law, and the law tracts on marriage since marriage was considered a contract in Early Irish and Welsh society. 
The literatures’ faithfulness to the regulations set by Early Irish law and the laws of Hywel Dda in relation to contract law is also explored. 
Each of the three stories involve important contracts made on inheritance and marriage between the main characters. 
The main question of this investigation is, to what extent is contract law applied in Tochmarc Étaine (‘The Wooing of Étaine’), 
Táin Bó Froích (‘The Cattle Rustling of Froích’) and Branwen, uerch Lyr (‘Branwen, daughter of Lyr’), and are the punishments in accordance with the law? 
The follow-up question is if the retribution for a breach in promise is in the confines of the law. 
I chose to explore these stories because they provide interesting examples of the use or misuse of contract law and the law tracts on marriage.

With Tochmarc Étaine, the regulations of Early Irish contract law is applied on the verbal contract between the Dagda, 
the chief god of the Túatha de Dannan, and Elcmar, a lesser deity. 
The contract discussed between the Dagda and Elcmar is about land, and to ensure Óengus, the god of love, inherits what is seen to be rightfully his. 
Elcmar made the promise that Óengus could have Brug na Boínne for a day and a night. 
However, the Dagda was not only the king, but also the judge in this matter and Óengus won Brug na Boínne by gaining a promise from Elcmar. 
The legality of the promise the Dagda gained from Elcmar can be called into question due to the lack of witnesses, a surety or a pledge. 
Without witnesses, sureties or pledges, a contract, verbal or otherwise, was not legally binding. Óengus should not have legally won Brug na Boínne, 
especially since Elcmar appeared to be ignorant of the faults in the contract. 
However, Elcmar, being a legally competent person, should have known that the Dagda is taking advantage of him and thus should have put an end to the disadvantageous contract.

Regarding the marriage of Étaine to Midir and Eochaid, the most important elements to their contracts are the verbs, buy (crenaid) or sell (renaid). 
These verbs were used in relation to the marriage Óengus arranged for Midir and the later acquisition of Étaine from her mortal husband, Eochaid Airem. 
Óengus states that he “shall purchase her”.
 However, Midir’s entire claim on Étaine was based on a stake from a game of fidchell and a promise Étaine made to him in private, without witnesses. 
As discussed previously, this weakens a verbal contract. Plus, the stakes from a game of fidchell is not shown to be a legal method of making contracts. 
Because of this, the only reason Midir achieved victory, was because Eochaid weakened his legal hold over his wife. Midir could not have won her back otherwise.

The main contract in Táin Bó Froích between Medb, Ailill and Froích for Findabair’s hand in marriage, is legally questionable. 
There were no witnesses present. Furthermore, the bride-price that Ailill named as the coibche (similar to a dowry), is out of the confines of the law because it far exceeds 
the reasonable amount and so Froích breaks off the contract. However, elopement was a legal form of union. 
Medb and Ailill had promised their daughter’s hand to many heroes in their army, so all their contracts were binding. 
Fearing retribution from these suitors, they try to murder Froích using a water monster in their pond. Froích survived the attack. 
Had he not, it is likely Ailill and Medb would have been required by law to pay a fine for secret killing due to the fact their murder weapon was a water monster 
they knew inhabited their pond. This punishment against Froích was not legal.

Finally, in Branwen, uerch Lyr, Bendigeidfran and Manawydan asked their sister for her consent and she gave it. 
Though not obvious in the text, Branwen permitting the marriage to take place, because she willingly slept with Matholwch at Aberffraw. 
This was an important as it sealed the marriage deal.
Furthermore there were witnesses present when the marriage was consummated, which validated it even more. 
There is one person who did not consent: Efnysien, Branwen’s half-brother. In retaliation, he mutilates Matholwch’s horses. 
The question on the matter of whether Efnysien’s consent was legally obligated to be given is a question posed before. 
Welsh laws only recognised the rights of the nearest male relatives in to consideration. 
The “nearest male relative” insinuated brother, father, uncle, son, etc, and not half-brother. 
Regarding Branwen’s marriage, Efnysien’s consent was not legally obligated to be considered. 
Efnysien is not part of the same agnatic kinship group as Branwen, Bendigeidfran and Manawydan as he did not inherit patrimony from the same father. 
Under the law, Efnysien is therefore not Branwen’s co-heir and hence, his consent was not a legal requirement. 
Branwen’s brother Bendigeidfran is not only her nearest male relative but he is also the king. His word overrules any of his subjects’, including Efnysien. 
Therefore, Efnysien’s violent retribution – the mutilation of the horses – is an illegal act.

My research so far has shown that there was a certain degree of legal knowledge shown by the scribes of the stories, but because I only looked at contract law 
and not other laws – and focused only on three Celtic stories, I am not quite sure if this trend continues in other legends.
