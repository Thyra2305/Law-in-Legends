<h1> Background on the laws </h1> 

 <h2> Old Irish Brehon law </h2>

The Irish law texts, also known as Brehon law from the Irish brethemon (judge), were originally oral in nature. 
They were first codified by Christian monks in the seventh and eighth centuries. 
The Críth Gablach (‘Branched Purchase’) law text, which was codified in 700 CE, dealt with the ranks of the members of a túath (tribe). 
It established a person’s honour-price, in addition to the property and wealth they were permitted to possess and their rights within their túath.
