<h2><strong> Introducing the Legends </strong></h2> 

When one thinks of Ireland, what image is conjured in your mind? A land that hums with life? Beer? The accent? The triskele? Lephrechauns? The Troubles? Potatoes? 
The same for Wales; what comes to mind? Y Ddraig Goch (the Red Dragon)? The sheep? The Crown? Llewyln ap Gruffud? Owain Glyndwr? Henry VII? 
Whatever one's image of both those countries may be, there are not many who immediately think of the rich literary, culutral history of the Ireland and Wales 
and the stories and legends that were told by bards of old and then written down by Christian scribes. Without the three stories I studied, or the others, we would
not be able to have a looking glass into the culture and the minds of the Medieval Insular (Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall) Celts. 

<h3><strong> Tormac Etaine </strong></h3>  

<p>
'Tormac Etaine' ('The Wooing of Etaine') is part of the Irish Mythological Cycle (a collection of stories that are purely based on Irish mythology) and is partially preserved in
the manuscript Lebor na hUidre ('Book of the Dun Cow', 1106 CE) and preserved in its complete form in the Yellow Book of Lecan (1401 CE). The book tells the story of the different loves of Etaine, a beautfiul mortal woman of the clan of the Ulaid, such as Midir of the Tuatha de Danann (Irish pantheon of gods) and Eochaid, a mortal man, and also tells the story of how Oengus, the god of love, managed to win land from Midir. This story is particularly interesting to research in the context of law in legends because the story has 
been described as displaying "poetic sense of law".
