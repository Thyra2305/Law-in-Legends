# Law-in-Legends
<h1> About the academic </h1>
Thyra SM van Veen, BA studied Celtic Languages and Culture at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and is currently following the Early Medieval Insular Languages and Culture track of the Research Master, Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies. The subjects that were studied were largely linguistic based – Old Irish and Middle Welsh – with Irish Brehon law and history of the Continental and Insular Celts thrown into the mix. Her personal field of interest is Irish land Welsh stories and folklore and law texts. Thyra's ambition is to do further research in these subjects, mainly through writing academic books. 
<p>
This research is the first in its field - as far as she can tell.
The purpose of the research is to see to which extent Old Irish Brehon law
and the laws of Hywel Dda are applied to three Celtic legends:
'Tormac Etain', 'Tain Bo Froich' and 'Branwen, uerch Lyr'.
