# Law-in-Legends
My Bachelor's thesis and further research
This research is the first in its field - as far as I can tell
The purpose of the research is to see to which extent Old Irish Brehon law
and the laws of Hywel Dda are applied to three Celtic legends:
'Tormac Etain', 'Tain Bo Froich' and 'Branwen, uerch Lyr'
