<h2><strong> Introducing the Legends </strong></h2> 

When one thinks of Ireland, what image is conjured in your mind? A land that hums with life? Beer? The accent? The beer, specifically Guinness? Red haired people? The triskele? Lephrechauns? The Troubles? Potatoes? 
The same for Wales; what comes to mind? Y Ddraig Goch (the Red Dragon)? Permanent rain? Unpronouncable place names? The Eisteddfod? The hills and sheep? Rugby? Popty-ping? Llewyln ap Gruffud? Owain Glyndwr? Henry VII? 
Whatever one's image of both those countries may be, there are not many who immediately think of the rich literary, culutral history of the Ireland and Wales 
and the stories and legends that were told by bards of old and then written down by Christian scribes. Without the three stories I studied, or the others, we would
not be able to have a looking glass into the culture and the minds of the Medieval Insular (Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall) Celts.

<h3><strong> Tormac Etaine </strong></h3>  

<p>
'Tormac Etaine' ('The Wooing of Etaine') is part of the Irish Mythological Cycle (a collection of stories that are purely based on Irish mythology) and is partially preserved in
the manuscript Lebor na hUidre ('Book of the Dun Cow', 1106 CE) and preserved in its complete form in the Yellow Book of Lecan (1401 CE). The book tells the story of the different loves of Etaine, a beautfiul mortal woman of the clan of the Ulaid (in Northern Ireland), such as Midir of the Tuatha de Danann (Irish pantheon of gods) and Eochaid, a mortal man, and also tells the story of how Oengus, the god of love, managed to win land from Midir. This story is particularly interesting to research in the context of law in legends because the story has 
been described as displaying "poetic sense of law".

<h4><strong> Tain Bo Froich </strong></h4>

<p> 'Tain Bo Froich' ('the Cattle Rustling of Froich', also known as the Romance of Froich and Findabair') is a wooing in the first part of the story. Froich, a nobleman with fairy origins, sets out to meet the daughter of Ailill and Medb, the monarchs of Connacht, named Findabair because he has heard the girl has fallen in love with him. After Froich rejects to pay an extorntionate bride-price, Ailill, fearing the abduction of his daughter, tries to prevent it by scheming Froich's death, which fails. Medb and Ailill later promise Findabair to Froich if he particpates in the cattle raid to seize the bull that Medb has had her eye on. In the second half of the story, Froich discovers his own cattle is stolen. </p>

<h5><strong> Branwen, uerch Lyr </strong></h5>

<p> 'Branwen, uerch Lyr' ('Branwen, daughter of Llyr') is the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, the most famous compendium of Welsh legends which was translated by Lady Charlotte Guest between 1838 and 1849. It is one of Four Branches. Bendigeidfran, Branwen's brother, is King and rules from Harlech, one of the seats of power of Wales in the medieval era. The king of Ireland, Matholwch, comes to Harlech to ask for Branwen's hand in marriage. Everyone agrees, except the half-brother Efnyisen. He mutilates Matholwch's horses and effectively causes war between Ireland and the British Isles because Matholwch still held a grudge, even after being compensated. </p>
